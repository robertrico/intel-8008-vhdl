> **New in v1.3:** Interrupts are fully operational! After extensive debugging and testing, the interrupt system now correctly handles interrupt acknowledge cycles, vector addressing, and return address preservation. The implementation includes new core system components (generic I/O controller, memory controller, interrupt controller with debouncing) and multiple interrupt-driven demonstration projects including a button-triggered Cylon LED effect. See [VERSIONS.md](VERSIONS.md) for complete version history.

> **Platform Note:** This project has been developed and tested exclusively on **macOS Sequoia 15.6.1**. Compatibility with other operating systems has not been verified.

## Overview

This project implements the Intel 8008 microprocessor (introduced April 1972) in VHDL, providing:

- **Complete 8008 CPU core** - All 48 instructions with cycle-accurate behavior
- **Fully functional interrupts** - Hardware-accurate interrupt handling with T1I acknowledge cycle, vector addressing, and return address preservation (v1.3)
- **Interactive monitor** - Real-time assembly program execution via VHPIDIRECT
- **Memory subsystem** - 2KB ROM + 1KB RAM with unified memory controller
- **Comprehensive test suite** - 13+ validated programs with assertion-based verification
- **FPGA deployment** - Running on real hardware! Multiple projects deploy to Lattice ECP5-5G including interrupt-driven I/O

Multiple demonstration projects showcase the system capabilities: from simple LED blink to interrupt-driven button input with debouncing. The interactive monitor provides a command-line interface for experimenting with 8008 assembly programs in simulation.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

#### 1. Install OSS CAD Suite

Install the [OSS CAD Suite](https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build) for VHDL simulation, synthesis, and FPGA tools. Follow the installation instructions for your platform on the OSS CAD Suite repository.

Extract to `~/oss-cad-suite` and ensure the tools are in your PATH.

#### 2. Install GHDL (Homebrew) - For Interactive Monitor Only

If you want to use the interactive monitor project, install GHDL via Homebrew (includes VHPIDIRECT support):

```bash
brew install --cask ghdl
```

This is only required for the monitor project's C integration. Standard simulation and synthesis work with OSS CAD Suite alone.

#### 3. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set USERNAME to your macOS username
```

### Hardware Blinky Project

**Deploy real 8008 assembly to FPGA hardware:**

```bash
cd projects/blinky
make deploy
```

This will:
1. Assemble [blinky.asm](projects/blinky/blinky.asm) (LED blink program in 8008 assembly)
2. Convert to memory initialization format
3. Synthesize the complete 8008 system for ECP5-5G FPGA
4. Generate bitstream
5. Program the FPGA

Watch LED0 blink! The program uses a delay loop written in pure 8008 assembly to create ~0.5 second on/off intervals. This is a complete 8008 system running real assembly code on real hardware.

See [projects/blinky/Makefile](projects/blinky/Makefile) for individual build steps and [projects/blinky/blinky.asm](projects/blinky/blinky.asm) for the assembly source with detailed comments.

### Interrupt-Driven Cylon Effect (NEW in v1.3!)

**See interrupts in action on real hardware:**

```bash
cd projects/cylon_interrupt
make deploy
```

This demonstrates the fully operational interrupt system with a Knight Rider-style LED effect advanced by button presses. Press the button and watch the hardware interrupt trigger the interrupt service routine that shifts the LED pattern. Includes comprehensive debug tooling for analyzing interrupt timing and behavior.

Also available:
- [Polling-based Cylon](projects/cylon/) - Basic LED animation without interrupts
- [Button-driven Cylon](projects/cylon_single/) - Button input via polling

### Interactive Monitor

The interactive monitor provides real-time interaction with the simulated 8008 CPU:

```bash
cd projects/monitor_8008
make all
```

You'll see:
```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  Intel 8008 Interactive Monitor           ║
║  Type '?' for help                        ║
║  Press Ctrl+C to stop simulation          ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════╝

Type ? for help
8008>
```

Available commands:
- `H` - Print "Hello, World!"
- `?` - Display help text
- `Q` - Quit (executes HLT instruction)

The simulation implements blocking I/O via VHPIDIRECT, allowing the simulated CPU to wait for user input while maintaining cycle-accurate timing.

### Run Test Programs

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
make test              # Main test suite (all instructions)
make test-search       # Run search algorithm
make test-ram-test     # RAM validation
make test-alu          # Arithmetic operations
make test-all          # Everything (comprehensive + units)
```

View waveforms in GTKWave:
```bash
make sim WAVE=1        # Auto-open GTKWave after simulation
```

## Using the 8008

### Writing Assembly Programs

This project uses [naken_asm](https://github.com/mikeakohn/naken_asm) by Michael Kohn for assembling 8008 code.

**Important:** naken_asm uses **8080 syntax** (Intel's later, more common mnemonics) rather than the original 8008 mnemonics. This means:
- Use `MOV` instead of `Lrr` (register-to-register moves)
- Use `MVI` instead of `LrI` (load immediate)
- Use `ADD`, `SUB`, etc. instead of `ADr`, `SUr`

This choice was made because 8080 syntax is more familiar and naken_asm already supports it.

**Example program:**

Create a new program in `test_programs/`:

```assembly
; my_program.asm - Add two numbers
.8008
.org 0x0000

start:
    mvi a, 0x42     ; Load 42 into accumulator (8080 syntax: MVI A)
    mvi b, 0x24     ; Load 24 into B register
    add b           ; Add B to accumulator (42 + 24 = 66)
    hlt             ; Halt

.end
```

**Assemble and load:**

```bash
make asm ROM_PROGRAM=my_program
make load-rom ROM_PROGRAM=my_program
```

**Test your program:**

```bash
make sim TEST=s8008_tb
```

### Assembly Syntax Reference

Common instructions in 8080 syntax (used by naken_asm):

| Instruction | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `mvi r, data` | Load immediate into register | `mvi a, 0x42` |
| `mov r1, r2` | Move register to register | `mov a, b` |
| `mov m, r` | Store register to memory [HL] | `mov m, a` |
| `mov r, m` | Load memory [HL] to register | `mov a, m` |
| `add r` | Add register to A | `add b` |
| `sub r` | Subtract register from A | `sub c` |
| `ana r` | AND register with A | `ana d` |
| `ora r` | OR register with A | `ora e` |
| `xra r` | XOR register with A | `xra h` |
| `cmp r` | Compare register with A | `cmp l` |
| `inr r` | Increment register | `inr a` |
| `dcr r` | Decrement register | `dcr b` |
| `jmp addr` | Jump to address | `jmp 0x100` |
| `jz addr` | Jump if zero | `jz LABEL` |
| `call addr` | Call subroutine | `call FUNC` |
| `ret` | Return from subroutine | `ret` |
| `hlt` | Halt | `hlt` |

Registers: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `h`, `l`, `m` (memory via HL)

See the [test_programs/](test_programs/) directory for complete working examples.

## Interactive Monitor (VHPIDIRECT)

The monitor project provides **real interactive I/O** - type commands and the 8008 responds in real-time!

### How It Works

The monitor uses GHDL's **VHPIDIRECT** feature to bridge VHDL simulation with C code:

```
Your Terminal
     ↕
C functions (console_vhpi.c)
     ↕
VHDL I/O peripheral (io_console_interactive.vhdl)
     ↕
8008 CPU (s8008.vhdl)
     ↕
Monitor program in ROM (monitor.asm)
```

When the 8008 executes `INP 2` (read keyboard), the simulation pauses until keyboard input is received. When it executes `OUT 0` (write character), output is immediately displayed to the terminal.

### Running the Monitor

```bash
cd projects/monitor_8008
make all
```

See [projects/monitor_8008/README.txt](projects/monitor_8008/README.txt) for full details on adding commands, extending functionality, and troubleshooting.

## Interrupt System: Implementation and Historical Context

> **Status (v1.3):** The interrupt system is fully operational and hardware-validated! This implementation correctly handles interrupt acknowledge cycles, RST vector addressing, and return address preservation. The system has been tested extensively in both simulation and on real FPGA hardware with button-triggered interrupts.

The Intel 8008 interrupt mechanism represents an early and minimalist approach to interrupt handling that differs significantly from later microprocessors. Understanding its operation requires careful analysis of the datasheet evolution and timing requirements.

### Interrupt Architecture Overview

The 8008 implements a **single-level, non-vectorized interrupt** with instruction injection capability. Unlike modern processors with interrupt vector tables or the 8080's hardware-vectored interrupts, the 8008's approach places significant responsibility on external hardware.

#### Key Characteristics:
- **Single INT input line** - No priority levels in hardware
- **Instruction injection mechanism** - External device supplies the first instruction byte
- **No automatic state save** - Software/external hardware must preserve context
- **Program Counter preservation** - PC is not incremented during interrupt acknowledge

### The Interrupt Sequence

#### 1. Interrupt Recognition (End of PCI Cycle)

The CPU samples the INT line **at the end of each Program Counter Increment (PCI) cycle** during the T3 state. This is critical:

- **PCI cycle**: A complete instruction fetch (T1-T2-T3 or T1-T2-T3-T4-T5)
- **Sampling point**: At T3 completion, when `microcode_state = FETCH`
- **Decision**: Transition to T1I (interrupt acknowledge) instead of T1 (next instruction)

**Important**: T1 and T1I are **mutually exclusive states**. The CPU never enters T1 before T1I. This distinction is crucial for correct hardware interfacing.

#### 2. Interrupt Acknowledge Cycle (T1I-T2-T3)

When INT is recognized, the CPU performs a special acknowledge cycle:

**T1I State** (State outputs S2 S1 S0 = 110):
- Lower 8 bits of Program Counter output on data bus
- **PC is NOT incremented** - preserved for return address

**T2 State**:
- Upper 6 bits of PC and cycle type code output
- External interrupt controller recognizes acknowledge

**T3 State**:
- External controller may optionally drive data bus
- Typical implementations don't use this cycle for instruction injection

#### 3. Instruction Injection (Subsequent PCI Cycle)

Following the T1I acknowledge cycle, a **normal PCI cycle** occurs:

**T1 State**: CPU outputs the same PC (still not incremented)

**T2 State**: Cycle type = "00" (PCI - instruction fetch)

**T3 State**: **External interrupt controller jams instruction byte onto data bus**
- Typical instruction: RST n (Restart to vector n)
- Alternative: CALL, JMP, or any valid instruction
- CPU latches this as if it were fetched from memory

**Critical Detail**: Only the first byte is supplied by external hardware. If a multi-byte instruction is injected (e.g., CALL), subsequent bytes are fetched from normal memory using the current PC value.

#### 4. Instruction Execution

The injected instruction executes normally through the CPU's standard decode and execution logic.

**For RST n instruction**:
1. Current PC is pushed onto the 8-level stack
2. PC is set to (n × 8) - vector address in page zero
3. Execution continues from the interrupt handler

**Vector Locations** (RST instruction):
```
RST 0 → 0x00  (8 bytes: 0x00-0x07)
RST 1 → 0x08  (8 bytes: 0x08-0x0F)
RST 2 → 0x10  (8 bytes: 0x10-0x17)
RST 3 → 0x18  (8 bytes: 0x18-0x1F)
RST 4 → 0x20  (8 bytes: 0x20-0x27)
RST 5 → 0x28  (8 bytes: 0x28-0x2F)
RST 6 → 0x30  (8 bytes: 0x30-0x37)
RST 7 → 0x38  (8 bytes: 0x38-0x3F)
```

Each vector has 8 bytes - typically contains a JMP to the actual handler or minimal inline code.

#### 5. Return from Interrupt

The interrupt handler executes and terminates with a RET instruction:
- RET pops the saved PC from the stack
- Execution resumes at the interrupted instruction
- No special "return from interrupt" instruction needed

### Implementation Challenges: v1.0 Design Flaw

The initial v1.0 implementation contained a critical interrupt handling error that would manifest as correct behavior in simulation but system freeze on physical hardware.

#### The Flawed Logic (v1.0):

```vhdl
-- INCORRECT: Checking interrupt during T1 state
when T1 =>
    if INT = '1' then
        timing_state <= T1I;  -- Wrong: Already in T1!
    else
        timing_state <= T2;
    end if;
```

#### Problems with This Approach:

1. **T1/T1I exclusivity violation**: CPU enters T1, outputs state code 000, then attempts to transition to T1I
2. **Spurious state output**: External hardware sees one clock of T1 before T1I acknowledge
3. **Possible mid-instruction interrupt**: Could sample INT during non-PCI cycles (immediate fetch, memory operations, etc.)
4. **PC increment ambiguity**: PC increment logic may execute before interrupt is recognized

#### Why It Appeared to Work in Simulation:

- Testbench timing may not assert INT during critical states
- Simplified interrupt controller models may ignore state code glitches
- Simulation may not exercise all instruction timing combinations
- Single-step execution masks timing-dependent behavior

#### Why It Fails on Hardware:

- Real interrupt controllers strictly decode state sequences
- Asynchronous interrupt timing exposes all edge cases
- PC corruption from improper increment timing
- Multi-byte instructions interrupted mid-fetch cause decode errors
- System deadlock from inconsistent state machine progression

### The Correct Implementation

#### Interrupt Detection at T3:

```vhdl
when T3 =>
    if microcode_state = FETCH then
        -- Just completed instruction fetch (PCI cycle)
        if is_halt_op = '1' then
            timing_state <= STOPPED;
        elsif INT = '1' then
            timing_state <= T1I;  -- Correct: T1I instead of T1
            -- PC must not increment
        elsif instruction_needs_execute = '1' then
            timing_state <= T4;
        else
            timing_state <= T1;
        end if;
    -- ... other T3 cases
```

#### Key Corrections:

1. **Sample INT at end of T3** during FETCH microcode state only
2. **Directly transition to T1I** - never enter T1 first
3. **Prevent PC increment** during T1I cycle
4. **Allow normal PCI cycle after T1I** for instruction injection
5. **Resume PC increment** after instruction injection completes

### Datasheet Evolution: Rev 1 (1972) vs. Rev 2 (1973)

An important historical note exists in the Intel datasheets that reveals a discovered timing bug in the original 8008 design.

#### Intel 8008 Datasheet Revision 2 (1973) - Critical Addition:

> **When the processor is interrupted, the system INTERRUPT signal must be synchronized with the leading edge of the φ1 or φ2 clock. To assure proper operation of the system, the interrupt line to the CPU must not be allowed to change within 200ns of the falling edge of φ1.** An example of a synchronizing circuit is shown on the schematic for the SIM8-01 (Section VII). This is a new circuit recently added to the SIM8-01 board.

(Emphasis added to highlight the explicit acknowledgment of this being a new requirement)

#### What Changed Between Revisions:

**Revision 1 (1972)**: No mention of interrupt signal synchronization requirements

**Revision 2 (1973)**: Added explicit timing constraints and synchronization circuit requirement

#### Analysis of the Timing Requirement:

**Setup/Hold Time Constraint**: ±200ns around φ1 falling edge
- Prevents metastability in interrupt detection logic
- Ensures clean sampling by internal flip-flops
- Requires external synchronization circuit

**Why This Matters**:
- The 8008 was pushing the limits of 1972 PMOS technology
- Internal synchronizers may have been minimal or absent
- Asynchronous INT input could cause race conditions
- Real systems exhibited interrupt-related failures

#### The SIM8-01 Reference Design Solution:

Intel's solution (added to SIM8-01 board) implemented an **external interrupt synchronizer**:
- Latches incoming interrupt requests
- Synchronizes to φ1/φ2 clock edges
- Ensures INT signal stability during sampling window
- Provides "acknowledged" flag to clear interrupt source

### Recommended VHDL Implementation Strategy

To properly implement 8008-compatible interrupt handling in VHDL:

#### 1. Interrupt Synchronizer Process

```vhdl
-- Separate process: clock-synchronized interrupt latch
signal int_latched : std_logic := '0';

process(phi1, phi2, reset_n)
begin
    if reset_n = '0' then
        int_latched <= '0';
    elsif rising_edge(phi1) then  -- Synchronized to clock
        -- Latch interrupt request
        if INT = '1' and int_latched = '0' then
            int_latched <= '1';
        end if

        -- Clear on acknowledge (entering T1I)
        if timing_state = T1I then
            int_latched <= '0';
        end if;
    end if;
end process;
```

#### 2. Use Latched Signal in State Machine

```vhdl
-- Use int_latched instead of raw INT signal
when T3 =>
    if microcode_state = FETCH then
        if int_latched = '1' then
            timing_state <= T1I;
```

#### Benefits:

- **Clock synchronization**: Meets Rev 2 timing requirements
- **Edge detection**: Triggers once per interrupt event
- **No retriggering**: Cleared on acknowledge, prevents loops
- **Metastability prevention**: Registered input avoids race conditions

### Connection to Modern Interrupt Systems

Understanding the 8008's interrupt mechanism illuminates the evolution of interrupt architecture:

#### 8008 Limitations:
- Single interrupt level (no priorities)
- No automatic state preservation
- External hardware complexity (instruction injection)
- Manual context save via software

#### Evolution to 8080/8085:
- Hardware-vectored interrupts (RST 0-7 directly)
- Multiple priority levels (8085: TRAP, RST 7.5, 6.5, 5.5)
- Simplified external hardware interface

#### Modern Microcontrollers:
- Nested interrupt controllers (NVIC, etc.)
- Automatic register save/restore
- Priority levels and preemption
- Vector tables in memory

**The 8008's approach** of having external hardware inject an instruction directly influenced the interrupt acknowledge bus cycle design that persisted through x86 architecture to the present day.

### Debugging Interrupt Issues

Common symptoms of incorrect interrupt implementation:

**Simulation appears correct, hardware freezes**:
- Likely cause: Improper INT sampling point (checking at T1 instead of T3)
- Likely cause: Missing interrupt synchronization
- Likely cause: PC being incremented during T1I

**Continuous interrupt loop**:
- Likely cause: Interrupt latch not cleared on acknowledge
- Likely cause: External hardware not seeing T1I state properly

**Random instruction execution**:
- Likely cause: Interrupt occurring during non-PCI cycle (immediate byte fetch, etc.)
- Likely cause: External hardware not properly jamming instruction byte

**State machine lockup**:
- Likely cause: T1/T1I exclusivity violated
- Likely cause: Microcode state corruption from mid-instruction interrupt

### Testing Interrupt Functionality

To validate interrupt implementation:

1. **Unit test**: Assert INT at various microcode states, verify only PCI interruption
2. **Timing test**: Verify T1I appears immediately after T3 (no intermediate T1)
3. **PC preservation test**: Confirm PC doesn't increment during T1I cycle
4. **Injection test**: Simulate external controller jamming RST instruction
5. **Return test**: Verify RET returns to correct PC after handler
6. **Synchronization test**: Apply asynchronous INT, verify no metastability

### Register Set
- **A (Accumulator)** - Primary arithmetic register
- **B, C, D, E, H, L** - General purpose registers
- **H:L Pair** - 14-bit memory pointer
- **PC** - 14-bit program counter
- **Stack** - 8 levels (return addresses only)

### Instruction Format
- **1-byte**: Register operations (e.g., `LAB`, `ADB`)
- **2-byte**: Immediate data (e.g., `LAI 0x42`)
- **3-byte**: Jumps and calls (14-bit addresses)

### Two-Phase Clock
The 8008 uses non-overlapping clocks:
- **φ1** - First phase (0.8µs high, 0.4µs dead time)
- **φ2** - Second phase (0.6µs high, 0.4µs dead time)
- **Period** - 2.2µs total (φ1 rise to next φ1 rise)

Our implementation generates these from a 100 MHz FPGA clock.

## FPGA Deployment - COMPLETE!

**Hardware Achievement:** The 8008 implementation is now running on real hardware! Multiple projects successfully deploy to the ECP5-5G board, including the blinky LED demo and interrupt-driven button input (v1.3).

### What's Working on Hardware

**Blinky Project** - [projects/blinky/](projects/blinky/)
- 76-line assembly program creates ~0.5s LED blink intervals
- Uses OUT instruction to drive LED bank (active-low, port 8)
- Delay subroutine with nested loops (~227,000 cycles per blink)
- Runs indefinitely, demonstrating stable FPGA operation

**Interrupt-Driven Cylon Effect** - [projects/cylon_interrupt/](projects/cylon_interrupt/) (NEW v1.3)
- Hardware-validated interrupt system with button-triggered interrupts
- RST 1 interrupt vector properly routes to interrupt service routine
- Return address correctly preserved and restored
- Hardware debouncer ensures clean button inputs
- Comprehensive debug tools included (state tracing, glitch analysis, timing verification)

**Cylon LED Projects** - Demonstration of polling vs. interrupts
- [Basic Cylon](projects/cylon/) - Polling-based LED animation
- [Button Cylon](projects/cylon_single/) - Button input via polling
- Shows evolution from polling to interrupt-driven design

**Complete System-on-Chip**
- Intel 8008 CPU core running at ~455 kHz
- 2KB ROM initialized with assembled program
- 1KB RAM for stack and data
- Generic I/O controller with interrupt support
- Memory controller for unified ROM/RAM access
- Interrupt controller with debouncing (synchronized per Rev 2 datasheet)
- Two-phase clock generator (φ1/φ2) from FPGA oscillator

**One-Command Deployment**
```bash
cd projects/blinky
make deploy
```

### Deployment Guide

#### Target Hardware

**Development Board:** Lattice ECP5-5G Versa Kit
- **Device:** LFE5UM5G-45F-8BG381C
- **Package:** 381-ball CABGA
- **Resources:** 45k LUTs, SERDES capable
- **Price:** ~$200 USD

The design is portable to other FPGAs (adjust constraints and Makefile settings).

#### Hardware Setup

**Board Configuration:**
1. Connect 12V power adapter
2. Connect USB cable (for programming)
3. Set DIP switches (SW4) to Master SPI mode: `010`
   - SW4.3: Down (CFG2 = 0)
   - SW4.2: Up (CFG1 = 1)
   - SW4.1: Down (CFG0 = 0)

**LED Observation:**
- LED0 (pin E16 via debug_led) - Main blink indicator
- Watch for steady 0.5s on / 0.5s off pattern

#### Build and Deploy

**Complete workflow (recommended):**
```bash
cd projects/blinky
make deploy
```

This runs: clean → assemble → convert → synthesize → program

**Individual steps:**
```bash
make asm           # Assemble blinky.asm → blinky.hex
make hex2mem       # Convert to memory format
make bitstream     # Synthesize FPGA bitstream
make program       # Flash to SRAM (volatile - for testing)
make flash         # Flash to persistent memory (survives power cycle)
```

**View synthesis reports:**
```bash
make reports       # Resource utilization and timing analysis
```

The synthesis flow:
1. **GHDL synthesis** - VHDL → Verilog
2. **Yosys synthesis** - Verilog → JSON netlist
3. **nextpnr place & route** - Logic placement and routing
4. **ecppack** - Generate bitstream
5. **openFPGALoader** - Program FPGA

### Pin Constraints

The blinky project uses its own constraint file at [projects/blinky/constraints/blinky.lpf](projects/blinky/constraints/blinky.lpf) which maps:
- Clock input to board's oscillator
- LED0 output (pin E16) for blink indicator
- Debug signals for optional logic analyzer connection

Modify this file to add:
- UART pins for terminal I/O (future work)
- Additional LEDs or switches for expanded functionality

### Next Steps for Hardware Development

**Current Status:** Core 8008 functionality fully validated on FPGA hardware, including interrupts!

Future enhancements:

1. **UART Interface** - Implement serial communication peripheral for terminal I/O
2. **Monitor on Hardware** - Adapt interactive monitor program to run on FPGA with UART
3. **Vintage Program Validation** - Run vintage 8008 programs from [jim11662418's 8008 SBC collection](https://github.com/jim11662418/Intel_8008_Single_Board_Computer)
4. **Performance Optimization** - Increase clock frequency beyond current ~455 kHz
5. **Resource Optimization** - Reduce LUT usage for smaller FPGA targets
6. **Additional Peripherals** - Add timers, GPIO, or other 8008-compatible peripherals
7. **Real Silicon Interface** - Design level shifter PCB for interfacing with real 8008 chip (PMOS -9V/0V logic)

## Development

### Toolchain

This project uses the open-source FPGA toolchain:

- **[GHDL](https://ghdl.github.io/ghdl/)** - VHDL simulator and synthesis
  - OSS CAD Suite version: Standard simulation and synthesis
  - Homebrew version: VHPIDIRECT support for monitor project
- **[Yosys](https://yosyshq.net/yosys/)** - Logic synthesis
- **[nextpnr](https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr)** - Place and route
- **[ecppack](https://github.com/YosysHQ/prjtrellis)** - Bitstream generation
- **[openFPGALoader](https://github.com/trabucayre/openFPGALoader)** - Programming
- **[GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/)** - Waveform viewer

### GHDL Configuration

The monitor project (`projects/monitor_8008/`) requires Homebrew's GHDL for VHPIDIRECT support (C function linking). The main project uses OSS CAD Suite's GHDL. If you don't need the interactive monitor, OSS CAD Suite alone is sufficient.

### Build System

The project uses a **unified Makefile system**:

- [Makefile](Makefile) - Project configuration (source files, test list)
- [common.mk](common.mk) - Shared build rules and tool setup

To add a new test:
1. Create `sim/my_test_tb.vhdl`
2. Add to `ALL_TB_SOURCES` in Makefile
3. Add stop time: `STOP_TIME_my_test_tb = 500us`
4. Run: `make sim TEST=my_test_tb`

### Design Evolution

This project evolved through several architectural approaches:

**Early Iterations** (in `src/iss/`):
- Modular glue-logic approach
- Separate components for address latching (8212), timing, etc.
- Designed to interface with **real 8008 silicon**

**Current v1.0** (in `src/components/`):
- **Monolithic softcore** design
- All logic integrated into `s8008.vhdl`
- Optimized for FPGA synthesis
- Easier to simulate and validate

**Future** (stretch goal):
- Return to glue-logic approach for **real silicon interfacing**
- The 8008 uses PMOS technology (-9V/0V logic levels)
- Requires custom level shifter PCB (3.3V FPGA ↔ -9V 8008)
- Design to begin now that FPGA validation is complete
