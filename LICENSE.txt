Intel 8008 VHDL Implementation - v1.0
======================================

Copyright (c) 2025 Robert Rico

This project is a cycle-accurate VHDL implementation of the Intel 8008
microprocessor for FPGA deployment, including system integration, memory
subsystem, comprehensive test suite, and interactive monitor.

IMPLEMENTATION
==============

Intel 8008 VHDL Implementation
-------------------------------
All VHDL code is an original implementation by Robert Rico (2025),
based on Intel's published specifications and datasheets.

Reference Materials:
- Intel 8008 Datasheet (1972, 1978)
- Intel 8008 User's Manual (1973)
- Intel SIM8-01 Reference Design Schematic

Note: During development, other HDL implementations were reviewed as
references for understanding different approaches to the 8008 architecture.

Assembly Toolchain
------------------
All test programs are assembled using AS Assembler (Macro Assembler AS) by Alfred Arnold:

  Tool: AS Assembler
  Author: Alfred Arnold
  Website: http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/as/
  License: GPL

This project uses 8080 syntax (MOV, MVI, ADD) rather than original 8008
mnemonics (Lrr, LrI, ADr) as supported by AS Assembler.

PROJECT EVOLUTION
==================

v1.0 - Monolithic Softcore (Current):
- Complete 8008 in s8008.vhdl (1795 lines)
- Cycle-accurate behavior per Intel specifications
- Optimized for FPGA synthesis
- Fully validated in simulation

Earlier Iterations (src/iss/, archived):
- Modular glue-logic components
- Designed for real 8008 silicon interface
- Preserved in git history

NO WARRANTY - HARDWARE RISK
============================

This hardware design is provided "as-is" without warranty of any kind.
Use at your own risk.

SIMULATION VS. HARDWARE STATUS:
- Simulation: Fully validated on macOS Sequoia 15.6.1
- FPGA Synthesis: Verified for Lattice ECP5-5G
- Hardware Deployment: Not yet tested on physical FPGA

When deploying to FPGA hardware:
- Verify board compatibility and pin constraints
- Test thoroughly before use in critical applications
- Proceed at your own risk

VINTAGE HARDWARE INTERFACING (FUTURE):
When interfacing with vintage Intel 8008 silicon:
- Verify voltage levels carefully (PMOS: -9V/0V vs. FPGA: 3.3V)
- Test with non-critical hardware first
- Use appropriate level shifters and protection circuitry
- The author is not responsible for any damage to vintage components
- Proceed at your own risk
